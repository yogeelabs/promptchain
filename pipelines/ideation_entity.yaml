    prompt: |
      You are a System Decomposer.

      Task:
      Given the input below, list ALL distinct entities that exist in the system.

      Rules:
      - Entities must be concrete or conceptual objects, not actions.
      - No explanations, no grouping yet.
      - Strictly One entity per line.
      - Include both visible and invisible entities.
      - Include entities even if they seem obvious or trivial.
      - Do not summarize.

      Input:
      {input}
    output: markdown
  - id: atomic_decomposition
    prompt: |
      You are an Exhaustive State Decomposer.

      Task:
      Break the following raw inputs into ATOMIC observations.

      Rules:
      - Do not summarize.
      - Do not give advice.
      - Do not propose solutions.
      - Each observation must be a single, objective fact.
      - Extract implicit facts if they are guaranteed by the text.

      For each atomic observation, label:
      1. Actor (who is doing it)
      2. Goal (what they are trying to achieve)
      3. Context (where / when / tool / environment)
      4. Friction (what resists progress)
      5. Workaround (what they do instead)
      6. Cost (time, money, attention, emotional)
      7. Frequency signal (one-time / repeated / habitual)

      Output:
      Numbered list.
      One atomic observation per line.

      Input:
      {input}
    output: markdown
  - id: ontology_level_decomposition
    prompt: |
      You are an Ontology Engineer.

      Break the input system into its fundamental entity types.

      For each category:
      - Give the category name
      - List all entities that belong to it

      Entity categories to consider:
      - Physical objects
      - Agents (humans or AI)
      - Representations (symbols, data, abstractions)
      - Tools / interfaces
      - Metrics / measurements
      - Constraints / rules
      - Contextual elements

      Input:
      {input}
    output: markdown
  - id: exhaustive_state_space_entity_enumerator
    prompt: |
      You are an Exhaustive Entity Enumerator.

      Task:
      Enumerate ALL entities that exist in the given system.

      Rules:
      - Include physical, digital, conceptual, and inferred entities.
      - Include entities that exist temporarily.
      - Include entities that are implied by rules, structure, or constraints.
      - Include entities created by representation (charts, UI, notation).
      - One atomic entity per line.
      - Continue until no new entities can be added.

      Input:
      {input}
    output: markdown
  - id: representation_aware_decomposition
    prompt: |
      You are a Representation Decomposition Engine.

      Given the input, break it into:
      1. Real-world entities
      2. Represented entities
      3. Abstract constructs
      4. Metadata entities
      5. Observer-facing entities

      Rules:
      - Treat charts, overlays, labels, timelines, and UI as entities.
      - Treat information itself as an entity if it is represented.

      Input:
      {input}
    output: markdown
  - id: system_blueprint_prompt
    prompt: |
      You are a System Blueprint Generator.

      Step 1:
      List all entities present in the system.

      Step 2:
      For each entity, specify:
      - Type (physical / digital / abstract / agent)
      - What it depends on to exist

      Rules:
      - No opinions or advice.
      - Treat the system as a machine.

      Input:
      {input}
    output: markdown
