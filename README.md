# PromptChain

Local-first, inspectable prompt chaining for deliberate multi-step workflows.

## Quickstart

```zsh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
scripts/smoke_placeholder.zsh
```

## Notes

- CLI and engine are implemented in later phases.
- Smoke script is a placeholder until Phase 1.
